Exercise 2 — Undo and History

1. Make a small change to script.sh but do NOT commit yet.
2. Run `git status` and note the output.
3. Use `git restore script.sh` to discard the change.
4. Make another change and commit it.
5. Use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` and see what happened.
6. Run `git log --oneline` after each step and note the differences.
